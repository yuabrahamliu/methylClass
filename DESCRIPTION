Description: methylClass is an R package for methylation-based classification. 
    In it, we provide the eSVM (ensemble-based support vector machine) model 
	able to achieve a much better accuracy in methylation data classification 
	than the popular random forest (RF) model, and also overcomes the time-
	consuming problem of traditional SVM. Additionally, some novel feature 
	selection methods, such as SCMER, are included in the package to improve 
	the classification. Furthermore, because methylation data can be converted 
	to other types of omics, such as copy number variation (CNV) data, we also 
	provide several functions for multi-omics study.
