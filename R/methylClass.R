
#'methylClass: an R package to construct DNA methylation-based classification 
#'  models
#'
#'The R package methylClass is special for performing DNA methylation-based 
#'  classification. Within it, we provide the eSVM (ensemble-based support 
#'  vector machine) model to achieve much higher accuracy in methylation data 
#'  classification than the popular random forest (RF) model and overcome the 
#'  time-consuming problem of the traditional SVM. In addition, some novel 
#'  feature selection methods, such as SCMER, are included in the package to 
#'  improve the classification. Furthermore, we also provide functions for 
#'  multi-omics studies.
